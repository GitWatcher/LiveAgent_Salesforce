/**
 ## Subproject Extensions
 
 This class is intended to be extended by sub-projects through the use of categories.  Each subproject can add whichever properties or methods to SCServiceCloud as needed for their various libraries.  Since these properties and methods will be exposed to developers consuming this SDK, it's important to ensure APIs that are exposed are clean and consistent with the rest of the project.
 
 The recommended approach for project-specific configurations would be to expose a sub-project's `SCManagedSingleton` public header to SCServiceCloud via a separate property.  For example, the Knowledge-specific user options are exposed through a property called `knowledge` on SCServiceCloud.
 
        - (SCKnowledgeInterface *)knowledge {
            SCKnowledgeInterface *result = nil;
            NSObject\<SCManagedSingleton\> *managedSingleton = self.manager[SCKnowledgeInterfaceManagerKey];
            if ([managedSingleton isKindOfClass:[SCKnowledgeInterface class]]) {
                result = (SCKnowledgeInterface*)managedSingleton;
            }
            return result;
        }

 Another option for settings that may be more universal than that would be to add the properties or methods directly to SCServiceCloud.
